WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="Molecular networks are visual displays of the chemical space present in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. This visualization approach can detect sets of spectra from related molecules (molecular networks), even when the spectra themselves are not matched to any known compounds. Classical molecular networking is well suited for discovery and can be analyzed directly from raw mass spectrometry files. Feature-based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is better when quantification analysis is necessary, but requires preprocessing with feature finding tools."
