WORKFLOW_VERSION=release_14
WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="One of the major limitations in discovering new chemical entities is determining which metabolites are known compounds within complex biological samples. A way to overcome this limitation is to compare the MS2 spectra of the unknown metabolite with a library of MS/MS spectra generated from structurally characterized metabolites. Herein, this comparison is based upon the similarity cosine scoring of MS/MS spectra."
