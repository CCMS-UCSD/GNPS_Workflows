## Requirements for each tool supported

Beside the specific requirements for each processing tool, it is possible to map any colum from the processing tool to the molecular networks using Cytoscape. See [https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-cytoscape/#import-supplementary-annotations-in-cytoscape](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-cytoscape/#import-supplementary-annotations-in-cytoscape).

### MZmine

The feature quantification table (.CSV file, comma separated) should have three columns named:

1. row ID
2. row m/z
3. row retention time

Additionally, to denote abundances for each file, the column name should contain the filename (with the extension) plus the suffix "Peak area" must appear. Other words can be present between the filename and "Peak area" suffixe, and those will be filtered out. 

The MGF output should contain the "SCANS" header, and it must correspond to the identifier of the "row ID". It has to be unique, and can be non sequential.

### MS-DIAL

The feature quantification table (.TXT file, tab-separated) should include upper 3 rows that are ignored and headers starting in row 4 with the following column headers:

1. Alignment ID
2. Average Mz
3. Average Rt(min)

For ion mobility data, it must include a "Average drift time" and "Average CCS" columns.

Additionally, it is assumed there are additional columns where the per sample quant starts at column 22. The sample headers are not including the filename extension (such as ".mzML")

The MGF output should contain the "SCANS" header, and it must correspond to the identifier of the "row ID". It has to be unique, and can be non sequential.

### MetaboScape

#### For MetaboScape 5.0

The feature quantification table (.CSV file, comma separated) should include columns with the following header:

1. SHARED_NAME
2. FEATURE_ID
3. RT
4. PEPMASS
5. CCS (optional, only tims/PASEF data)
6. SIGMA_SCORE
7. NAME_METABOSCAPE
8. MOLECULAR_FORMULA
9. ADDUCT
10. KEGG
11. CAS
12. MaxIntensity
13. {GroupName}_MeanIntensity (0-n times, dependent on the groups defined in MetaboScape)
14. Sample Intensities

All sample headers are not including the file format extension ".d" (DDA) or ".tdf" (PASEF). The columns "FEATURE_ID", "RT", "PEPMASS", "MaxIntensity" are mandatory. 
Important: In the metadata table, the filename MUST NOT HAVE the extension suffixe indicated.

#### Earlier versions of MetaboScape (<5.0)

The feature quantification table (.CSV file, comma separated) should include columns with the following header:

1. SHARED_NAME
2. FEATURE_ID
3. RT
4. PEPMASS
5. NAME
6. MOLECULAR_FORMULA
7. ADDUCT
8. KEGG
9. CAS
10. {GroupName}_MeanIntensity (0-n times, dependent on the groups defined in MetaboScape)
11. Sample Intensities

Sample headers are including the file format extension ".d". The columns "FEATURE_ID", "RT", "PEPMASS", "CAS" are mandatory. 
Important: In the metadata table, the filename MUST HAVE the ".d" extensionsuffixe.

### Progenesis QI

The feature quantification table of Progenesis is a text file. We now support either comma separated text file with dot as decimal separator or the European standard with semicolon separated text file with comma as separator. Make sure you follow the export instructions as mentioned at [https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-progenesisQI](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-progenesisQI/). Representative input files are available at [https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows/tree/master/feature-based-molecular-networking/test/reference_input_file_for_formatter](https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows/tree/master/feature-based-molecular-networking/test/reference_input_file_for_formatter).

The "Normalised abundances" columns are mandatory along with "Compound", "Retention time (min)", "m/z".

The conversion script is located at [https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows/blob/master/feature-based-molecular-networking/tools/feature-based-molecular-networking/scripts/progenesis_formatter.py](https://github.com/CCMS-UCSD/GNPS_Workflows/blob/master/feature-based-molecular-networking/tools/feature-based-molecular-networking/scripts/progenesis_formatter.py).

For ion mobility data, it must include a "CCS (angstrom^2)" column for consistency

If both 'Row abundances' and 'Normalised abundances' are present, we output only 'Normalised abundances' columns. All sample headers are not including the filename extension (such as ".raw"). 
We output most metadata columns except the 'Accepted Description' column. These columns are on the row 3 of the input feature quantification table.

We use the .MSP file format for the MS/MS spectral summary and convert it to a.MGF file. Only the first MS/MS entry associated with a compound name is kept in the .MGF file (Following "Comment: "). This is an imperfect solution and we are welcoming volunteers to improve this.

### OpenMS

The standard output of the TextExport tools applied on a consensusXML file is used (tab-separated). See this page for format description [https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/release/latest/html/TOPP_TextExporter.html](https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/release/latest/html/TOPP_TextExporter.html)

All sample headers should include the filename extension (such as ".mzML").

The MGF output should contain the "SCANS" header, and it must correspond to the identifier of the "row ID". It has to be unique, and can be non sequential.

### XCMS3

The feature quantification table (.TXT format, tab-separated) should include a header row with the following headers:

1. Row.names - where the feature identifier is prefixed with "FT"
2. mzmed
3. rtmed

Following these headers are the samples. 

The MGF output should contain the "SCANS" header, and it must correspond to the identifier of the "row ID". It has to be unique, and can be non sequential.
