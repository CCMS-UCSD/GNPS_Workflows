WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION='Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on GNPS. Please cite <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/812404">Nothias LF et al. bioRxiv 2019</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3597"> Wang M et al. Nat. Biotech. 2016</a>. The supported tools are: MZmine, OpenMS, MS-DIAL, MetaboScape, XCMS, Progenesis QI, and the mzTab-M format. See the documentation at <a href="https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/">https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/</a>. FBMN facilitates the detection of isomers that are separated by chromatographic or ion mobility separation, and provides accurate ion abundances for statistical analysis. Note that FBMN requires processing the mass spectrometry data with a feature detection and alignment tool. For rapid/qualitative analysis, we recommend using classical molecular networking that accepts unprocessed mass spectrometry files.'
