WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on GNPS. The supported tools are: MZmine, OpenMS, MS-DIAL, MetaboScape, XCMS, Progenesis QI, and the mzTab-M format. FBMN is better when quantification analysis is necessary, but requires preprocessing with feature finding tools. Classical molecular networking is better for discovery and can be analyzed directly from raw mass spectrometry files."
